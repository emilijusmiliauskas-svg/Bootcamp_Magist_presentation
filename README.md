## About this Repo  
This repository contains my project analyzing the Magist database, reframed from an initial e-commerce assumption to its actual role as an order management and delivery service. It includes SQL analysis, Tableau visualizations, and a structured business reflection.  

The repo is designed to demonstrate not only technical competency in handling messy real-world data but also the ability to extract KPIs, communicate insights to business stakeholders, and evaluate strategic and executional fit for premium product readiness.

## Summary  
This project analyzes the Magist database (an order management and delivery service) to assess whether the platform could support selling high-end tech accessories (~540 € average price) for a major tech company.  

At an early stage, I understood that Magist is an e-commerce marketplace. After correction, the focus was adjusted to properly evaluate Magist as an order management and delivery company. This required reworking about half of the original slides to reflect the correct business model.  

Using SQL and data analysis techniques, I evaluated strategic fit (customer behavior, payment systems, reviews, transaction capabilities) and executional fit (approval time, delivery performance). The project concludes with recommendations and a presentation-ready set of visualizations.

## Languages and Libraries Used  
- Tableau for data visualization  
- SQL for analysis and exploration  
- Git/GitHub for version control and project sharing  
- Gamma for creating and editing presentation-ready slides  
- CSV datasets exported from Magist database

## Key Learnings  
- Strengthened my ability to merge complex datasets (orders, reviews, payments, products)  
- Practiced defining business KPIs relevant for premium retail (AOV, payment installments, review sentiment)  
- Improved data storytelling: turning raw metrics into a structured presentation with charts  
- Practiced working collaboratively and adapting to feedback, improving teamwork and communication skills

## Challenges Overcame  
- Price comparisons: Many products were very cheap; I had to contextualize KPIs (for example, showing why 100–200 € AOV is “promising,” but still far from 540 €).  
- Business framing: Needed to correct the initial assumption that Magist was an e-commerce marketplace, and reframe the analysis for its actual role as an order management and delivery service.  
- Team collaboration: Incorporated feedback from peers and mentors, which required reworking parts of the analysis and presentation. This improved the clarity of my findings and strengthened my teamwork skills.

## Additional Reflections   
- Creating polished slides with Gamma helped me focus on clarity and effective communication of results, while also reflecting the kind of presentation expected in professional business settings.
